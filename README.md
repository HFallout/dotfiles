All Dem Dots
====================

This is mostly for my own benefit but feel free to use whatever you like.

I use awesome window manager, with the theme called 'default' in my .config/awesome/themes/
It's not the actual default theme, but one that matches the [Jellybeans Vim theme](https://github.com/nanotech/jellybeans.vim "jellybeans.vim") which I recently started using in vim.

[Dina Font](https://www.archlinux.org/packages/community/any/dina-font/) is my go-to font for all my monospace needs, if anyone is wondering. The vim plugns I use are listed at the top of my vimrc, they're not in .vim since I installed them via packer.
