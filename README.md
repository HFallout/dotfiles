All Dem Dots
====================

This is mostly for my own benefit but feel free to use whatever you like.

I use awesome window manager, with the theme called 'default' in my .config/awesome/themes/
It's not the actual default theme, but one that matches the [Tomorrow Night Eighties Theme](https://github.com/chriskempson/tomorrow-theme "Tomorrow Theme") which I use in teh terminal and vim because I love it oh so much.
