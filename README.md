All Dem Dots
====================

This is mostly for my own benefit but feel free to use whatever you like.

I use awesome window manager, with the theme called 'default' in my .config/awesome/themes/
It's not the actual default theme, but one that matches the [Jellybeans Vim theme](https://github.com/nanotech/jellybeans.vim "jellybeans.vim") which I recently started using in vim.
